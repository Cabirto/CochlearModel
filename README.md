This work aims to implement the 1D Cochlear Model from Fruth, F., JÃ¼licher, F., & Lindner, B. (2014). An active oscillator model describes the statistics of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions. Biophysical journal, 107(4), 815-824.

The model was adapted to study the response of the Cochlea to an external forcing.
